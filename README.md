## Description:   
Neri's Miscellaneous helper functions, provided to help others use my scripts.  Some snippets are taken from various places in the web, if you think I forked or copied your code and want me to remove something, just let me know...  

Disclaimer  
---------------------------
I am a self admitting bad programer and I can't even vouch this thing is installable. Still, sharing is caring...  
"The code is provided for the purposes of disclosure rather than as a product. The scripts are heavily environment-dependent and may not be able to work on other platforms without extensive modification.  "
